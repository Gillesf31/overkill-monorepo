# OverkillMonorepo

Welcome to OverkillMonorepo!

It is a monorepo with two Angular applications, one for todo management and one for user management.

Without modules and without constructors, I used NGXS for state management.

I used NX types and scopes to organize the code.

Feel free to make any suggestions or improvements.
